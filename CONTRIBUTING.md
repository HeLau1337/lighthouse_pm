# Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the project. But before you start take a look at the issues because 
someone may already be working on it.

## Issues

If you have a bug, or feature request you are free to make an issue.  
Please make sure the issue is as precise as possible and as detailed as possible.

Sometimes it may be better to open two separate issues instead of trying to put it all into 
a single issue.
